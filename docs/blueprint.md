- Dark theme cards: Slightly lighter near-black (#0D0D0D) to provide visual separation while maintaining the dark ambiance.
- Dark theme primary/accent: White/off-white (#FAFAFA) for high contrast and readability.
- Light theme background: White (#FFFFFF) to provide a sense of clarity and openness.
- Light theme primary/accent: Near-black (#171717) for clear and accessible text.
- Headlines: 'Alegreya' (serif) for an elegant and intellectual feel.
- Body text: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern and readable appearance. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Lucide React icons for a clean and consistent interface.
